<h2 align="center">🛠 Prerequisites</h2>

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- 🌐 **Amazon Web Services (AWS) Account:** The application is deployed using AWS services, including EC2, S3, and RDS. To modify or redeploy the application, you'll need an AWS account. Sign up [here](https://aws.amazon.com/).
- 🔑 **Amazon Academy Learner Lab Credentials:** Access the current deployment through Amazon Academy Learner Lab credentials. Have these credentials ready.
- 🖥 **Git:** To clone and manage the project repository.
- ☁ **Basic Knowledge of Cloud Services:** Familiarity with AWS services like EC2, S3, and RDS is beneficial.
- 🌍 **Internet Connection:** To access cloud services and deploy the application.

<h2 align="center">🖥 Installation & Setup</h2>

### 1. Setting up the RDS for Database 🗃

1. **Launch an RDS instance** on AWS:
   - Navigate to the RDS service in the AWS Management Console.
   - Choose the database engine (e.g., MySQL).
   - Configure the instance specifications, security groups, and other settings as needed.
   - Launch the RDS instance and note down the endpoint.
2. **SSH into your EC2 instance** (if not already connected):
   ```bash
   ssh -i "your-key-pair.pem" ec2-user@your-ec2-instance-ip
3. **Install the MySQL client on the EC2 instance**:
   ```bash
   sudo yum install mysql
4. **Connect to the RDS database from the EC2 instance**:
   ```bash
   mysql -h your-rds-endpoint -u your-username -p
5. **Create a database named `myappdb`**:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE myappdb;
   USE myappdb;
6. **Run the database setup script to configure the tables and other database structures**:
   ```sql
   SOURCE setup-database.sql;
7. **Verify the database setup by checking the tables**:
   ```sql
   SHOW TABLES;
   EXIT;

### 2. Setting Up an Amazon S3 Bucket

1. **Sign in to AWS**:
   - Go to [AWS Console](https://aws.amazon.com/) and sign in.
2. **Access S3**:
   - Select "S3" from Services or search for it.
3. **Create Bucket**:
   - Click "Create bucket".
   - Name it (names are globally unique) and choose a region.
4. **Configure Settings**:
   - Adjust "Properties" and "Permissions" as needed.
   - UniShare currently alows anyone to upload files with an open policy

### 3. Setting up the EC2 for Web Server

1. **Launch an EC2 instance** on AWS and ensure it's running.
2. **SSH into the EC2 instance** using your preferred terminal or SSH client:
   ```bash
   ssh -i "your-key-pair.pem" ec2-user@your-ec2-instance-ip
3. **Clone the UniShare repository**:
   ```bash
   sudo yum install git
   git clone https://github.com/choskin1/UniShare.git
4. **Setup the connection to the database** by changing line 13 in main, the result should look like this
    ```bash
    app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'mysql+pymysql://<username>:<passoword>@<database endpoint>/myappdb'
5. **Setup the connection to the s3 bucket** by ensuring that the name of the bucket is approipately referenced in upload_to_s3() and in view_files()
5. **Navigate to the cloned repository** and run the frontend startup script:
   ```bash
   cd UniShare
   ./setup-frontend.sh
6. This will start the main Python application and create a server operating on port `5001`.

<h2 align="center">🏛 Application Design & Architecture 🏛</h2>

### 🧱 Architecture Components:

🖥 **Web Server (EC2)**:
- 🚀 Hosts the main application and serves user requests.
- 🗂 Interacts with the RDS database for data retrieval and storage.
- 📦 Communicates with the S3 bucket for file storage and retrieval.

🗄 **Database (RDS)**:
- 💾 Stores user data, study group details, and other essential information.
- ✅ Ensures data consistency and integrity.

📂 **File Storage (S3)**:
- 🔒 Securely stores and serves user-uploaded files like notes and assignments.
- 🔄 Provides high availability and redundancy for stored files.

--- 
### 🔄 Data Flow:

🖱 **User Interaction**:
- 🌐 Users access UniShare via a web browser.
- 📤 User actions (like creating a study group or uploading a file) send requests to the EC2 web server.

⚙ **Server Processing**:
- 🖥 The EC2 instance processes user requests.
- 🗂 For data-related operations, it communicates with the RDS database.
- 📦 For file operations, it interacts with the S3 bucket.

📬 **Response Generation**:
- 📝 Once the server processes the request, it generates an appropriate response.
- 🖥 This response is then sent back to the user's browser for rendering.

### 🔐 Security:

- 🚫 **Access Control**: UniShare implements strict access controls to ensure that only authorized users can access specific resources.
